## What is Notey?
Notey is a free and open-source text editor available to everyone. It's designed to be simple, with the code being human-readable and well commented, so people wanting to learn programming/C# can have a good place to start.

## Why not just use Notepad?
Fair question. Notey is mostly just a project for myself, however it's also meant to be much more than just plain old notepad. I'm planning to add formatting, etc. You can already load Rich-Text Format (.rtf) files, and the formatting works perfectly fine from what I can see. Hopefully this will improve later down the line.

## Installing
Installing and using Notey should be as simple as downloading the latest release and running it.

**NOTE! THE WINDOWS SMARTSCREEN WINDOW WILL APPEAR!**
For those concerned, this program is not a virus, however it has not been signed (as I am currently unable to), therefore the Windows smartscreen window will show up.
If you are that concerned, feel free to build directly from source. The experience will be no different, but you are free to do as you please.

## Contributing
Right now I am not really accepting contributions, sorry. Feel free to leave feedback and ideas for features you would like. Once the program is more feature-complete I will look into allowing contributions.
